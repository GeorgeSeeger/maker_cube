# Technical notes

This git repository has two submodules. These are basically separate git repositories nested within this git repository.

The sub modules are repositories that contain drivers for the LED screens. These can be used in a number of projects and should kept up to date.

To clone all of the nested repos run the following form the command line:

`$git clone --recursive https://github.com/sultanhq/maker_cube.git`

If there has been a change to the sub modules you can pull all the updated modules using:

`$git submodule update --recursive`
